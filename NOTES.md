### Apr 5th, 2020

Cleaned up and started repositories from scratch.

Added HACS, bigcard, flex-horseshoe

Tried to add Climate Card from [Lau-ie/HassOS-Config](https://github.com/Lau-ie/HassOS-Config), but ran into problems with flex-horseshoe, eventually found
[bug report](https://github.com/AmoebeLabs/flex-horseshoe-card/pull/14) and patched by hand. Lau-ie also wrote flex-horseshoe-card

Moved Climate card to front and added a sensors view, to keep raw sensor information.
